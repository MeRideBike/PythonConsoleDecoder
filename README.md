# PythonConsoleDecoder

This script grabs the first table from either a local HTML file or a live URL. It expects that table to define some characters and the (x, y) coordinates where they should be placed on a grid. From there, it figures out how big the grid needs to be, drops each character into its proper spot, and prints the full layout so you can visually read the hidden message.
